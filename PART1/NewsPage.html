          <p style="background-color: black;">- SpaceX has recently tested its serial number 9 starship after a week of anxious waiting for the FAA to approve the launch.
            The launch took place on the 2nd of February at the Boca Chica test centre. The rocket aimed to fly as high as 10km and the hover for a
            small amount of time before falling on its belly back down to the ground before reigniting the engines and correctly landing. The rocket
            achieved everything from launch to the freefall but failed to successfully land and ended up exploding after hitting the ground.
          </p>
          <p style="background-color: black;">- Alongside the test of SN9 SpaceX have also begun reconstruction of its sea-based take-off and landing platforms. The former oil rigs
            were bought for 7 million and named them Phobos and Deimos. They are planning to have these oil rigs converted so that its new starship
            can be launched from the sea thus lowering the amount of noise pollution in cities and ensuring people's safety.
          </p>
          <p style="background-color: black;">- Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos has stepped down from his role at Amazon so that he can focus more of his time on Blue Origin. Blue Origin
            is currently working on its New Shepard rocket trying to improve it so that it can take astronauts or payloads past the Karmian line which is
            the boundary of space. They are working on making it safer and more reliable as of current.

            will start a complex set of sensors to collect data. NASA is also making progress on its Artemis program and is testing its rockets core stage and all of its integrated
            systems. They are targeting another test for the week of February 21.

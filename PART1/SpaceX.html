          <p style="background-color: black;">One of SpaceX's main goals is to eventually in the next couple of years be able to travel to Mars as efficiently
            and cost-effectively as possible. To achieve this SpaceX as investing a lot of resources into developing new rocket
            technology so that they can travel to Mars with enough equipment and technology so that they can set up
            a colony on Mars. Elon Musk the CEO of SpaceX has constantly reinforced the idea that the next advancement for humans
            is to colonize other planets and convert them into suitable environments for human habitation.
          </p>
          <p style="background-color: black;">SpaceX knows that if they want to achieve their goals of colonizing Mars then there are several obstacles that
            they need to confront first. One of these obstacles is to lower the cost of space travel so that they can carry out a
            vast number of launches simultaneously, so over the past couple of years SpaceX has been focusing on developing rockets that
            are reusable so that they can lower the cist of every launch. They have made a lot of progress on this front as can be seen
            by the Falcon 9 rocket and its boosters which have been reused for many launches.

          <p style="background-color: black;">SpaceX is also working on setting up a high-speed, low latency broadband internet. Currently, SpaceX is still launching
            Starlink satellites and it is in its beta stage currently. Although it is in its beta stage data speeds are varying form 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency
            between 20ms and 40ms. They are currently working on installing ground stations as well as improving the networking software and data speed.

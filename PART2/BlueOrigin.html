          <p>Blue Origin aims to preserve the Earth and make use of other planets, moons and asteroids to mine
            for resources that can be transported back to the Earth. They also have plans to move industries and factories to other planets, or moons
            so we can reduce the amount of pollution on our planet, thus meaning that we can keep our home planet protected.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin to achieve their goal of utilizing other planets for the benefit of Earth are working
            on creating reusable rockets that will lower the cost of travelling in space meaning that it is a viable solution. They are working on being able
            to reuse the rockets first stage with minimal refurbishment, lowering the cost of launch and increasing the rate at which these rockets can be
            launched. They are working to develop rockets that after launch can return to earth and land safely which will again decrease the cost of
            launch and increases the availability for customers. They are developing rockets that can carry as great a

          <p>Blue Origin is working on the Blue Moon which is a lunar landing system for crew and cargo. The cargo lander
            is designed so that it will provide reliable and cost-effective delivery to the moon and the human landing system is being developed for NASA

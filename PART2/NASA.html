            of new technologies so that they can explore more of the lunar surface than has ever been explored before. They are collaborating with commercial and international partners such as
            Blue Origin.  The Space Launch System is another one of NASA's current aims to develop a heavy-lift launch vehicle so that we can expand our presence to destinations beyond Earth.</p>

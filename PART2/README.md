Improving Original Website

Part 2 of the project focuses on taking the website we created in Part 1 and applying improvements. A main focus of this part is to focus on the design focus, this can be seen by the creation of wireframe models before the actual coding. Also another focus is to make use of JavaScript to create a more advanced website, that the user can interact with more. The last key element is to make sure that we overhaul the styling to make it more appealing and make sure that the website is responsive so it works on a range of screen sizes.

            The launch took place on the 2nd of February at the Boca Chica test centre. The rocket aimed to fly as high as 10km and the hover for a
            small amount of time before falling on its belly back down to the ground before reigniting the engines and correctly landing. The rocket
            achieved everything from launch to the freefall but failed to successfully land and ended up exploding after hitting the ground.</p>
          <p>- Alongside the test of SN9 SpaceX have also begun reconstruction of its sea-based take-off and landing platforms. The former oil rigs
            were bought for 7 million and named them
